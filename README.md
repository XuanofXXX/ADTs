# Features
The project is a practice of Data Structure course in RUC,2023-2024 S3.
The project is written in C++. And it contains the basic data structure and some labs. Another feature is the HTMLParser.It can parse the HTML file and get the content of the file.

# What I achieved:
## 1. Basic Data Structure
The followings are located in `/DataStructure/` directory.
- Dynamic List
- Single linked list
- Pair
- Queue
- Stack
- String methods

## 2. Labs
### 2.1 String operation

- operate on the appointed string
- Split the input-strings into a List of words by space, punctuation(both Chinese and English).
- insert a word into the List by index
- delete a word from the List by index or value
- reverse the appointed string.
- get the length of the appointed string.
- get the counts of the appointed word in appointed string.

in `HtmlParser.cpp`,`lab2.cpp`, we
